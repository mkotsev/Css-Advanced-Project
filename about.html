            We started as a group of volunteers, united by our love of animals. Our devotion to rescuing, caring and finding home for stray dogs and cats helped a lot of animals to be saved. Inspired by these results, we decided to set up our animal rescue foundation - “Sharo”.

        <p>Finally, we hope that by accomplishing our goals, we will create opportunities to help humans and animals get to know and love each other; we want to awaken, nurture and encourage a sense of responsibility in people towards animals, whose destiny is in our hands. They depend on us. It is our duty to care for those we decided to domesticate hundreds of years ago. Today, just like then, we are once again in the position of the power. Let us be noble and caring and treat those in need with kindness and compassion.</p>
